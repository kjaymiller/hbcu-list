This is a list pulled from Wikipedia of all the HBCUs in the United States.

My Goal is to let People Learning Python Play with this data and make what they want with it, all while providing a resource for HBCUs to look for potential computer science prospects.

# What can you do with this?
It's MIT LICENSED so fork the code and have fun. I have plans for this data myself.
